# FEB Default Setter

**ARCHIVED**
*This repository has been archived as it has been largely taken over by the [FE-ASSISTANT](https://github.com/KSanders7070/FE-ASSISTANT) project. It will still work, but is not being actively developed.*

A simple Python-based vidmap default setter for use with [FE-BUDDY](https://github.com/Nikolai558/FE-BUDDY).

## Requirements

Python3.8 or Later (Tested with Python 3.10.12)

Only imports are JSON, and OS, so it should run on a standard Python implementation.

## Instructions for use

1. Copy or move (the original files will not be overwritten) the files from the `FE-BUDDY_OUTPUT/CRC/vNAS BATCH UPLOAD` directory in to the `feb_source` directory.
2. Run the following command:
   <br/>
   ```
   python3 setdefaults.py
   ```
3. The resulting files will be found in an `output` directory.

### Optional Command Line Arguments

By default, the script looks for the defaults file in the `feb_source` directory, in a file called `vNAS_Defaults.txt`. It will then place all of the processed files in an `output` directory.

Each of these can be overridden by the following command line flags:

1. `--sourcedir` - Sets the source directory path (relative or full).

```
Example:
--sourcedir "/Users/kyle/Downloads"
```

2. `--outputdir` - Sets the output directory path (relative or full). It will create it if it does not currently exist.

```
Example:
--outputdir "/Users/kyle/Documents"
```

3. `--defaultsfile` - Sets the filepath of the defaults file.

```
Example:
--defaultsfile "/Users/kyle/Downloads/vNAS_Defaults.txt"
```
