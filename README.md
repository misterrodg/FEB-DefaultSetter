# FEB Default Setter

A simple Python-based vidmap default setter for use with [FE-BUDDY](https://github.com/Nikolai558/FE-BUDDY).

## Requirements

Python3.8 or Later (Tested with Python 3.10.12)

Only imports are JSON, and OS, so it should run on a standard Python implementation.

## Instructions for use

1. Copy or move (the original files will not be overwritten) the files from the `FE-BUDDY_OUTPUT/CRC/vNAS BATCH UPLOAD` directory in to the `feb_source` directory.
2. Run the following command:
   <br/>
   ```
   python3 setdefaults.py
   ```
3. The resulting files will be found in an `output` directory.
